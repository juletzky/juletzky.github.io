  <h1>My poster at the 1st IMPRS Summer School 2024 at UCL London</h1>
    <p>I had the chance to present the findings from the first year of my PhD at this year's IMPRS Summer School at University College London. The results are part of the pilot that I am currently running to better understand the effects of isochronicity on behaviour in turn-taking situations. We eventually want to measure neural oscillations and their entrainment to speech directly using neuroimaging. However, we do want to correlate the degree of entrainment with a behavioral measure, the speed of taking the turn. The results from this pilot show that more isochronous sentences, which lend themselves better to entrainment, garner faster reaction times from our participants.  </p>
